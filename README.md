Iris dataset was loaded to the python environment. 
Different classification models were fitted to the data viz. Logistic Regression, kNN, Decision Tree, SVM and Random Forest. 
All the models gave same prediction values like precision score, recall score, confusion matrix, accuracy etc. 
All models was 100% accurate in predicting target variable from test data. 
This may be since, different classes of the data are well differentiated from each other.
